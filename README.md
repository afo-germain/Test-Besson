# Requirements
JDK 11.0.18

# Run
This project is a simple command line project and to run it, we can use Netbeans or Eclipse as IDE.
With this we clean & build the project and after that we run.

# Usage
We just have to say if the transport costs will be at the expense of the sender or not.
The program will compute the total amount corresponding to the sender, receiver and your response.
By default, we use the first client as sender and the second one as receiver but this can be changed easily by setting their index.
